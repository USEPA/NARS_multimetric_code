# NARS_multimetric_code

## Description

The goal of the code in this repository to provide functions that can be used 
to screen candidate metrics and perform best subsets analysis to evaluate
various combinations of metrics for use in a multimetric index (MMI). There are 
examples that can be used to see how to call the functions.

## Details

To use the code in this repository, there are a few key folders to use. The 
`R` folder contains the code for the various functions. Opening these files 
allows the user to update or alter the code for their own purposes. The `html`
folder contains the help file for each function, whereas the `man` folder 
contains the markdown file used to create the .html files. The code and data 
used to run examples are contained in the `examples` folder. 

To run the examples without having to alter the code, use the .Rproj file to 
open as a project in R. That will allow the code using the `here::here()` 
function to locate data files.
