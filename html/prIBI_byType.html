<h2>Construct and evaluate MMI based on metric types</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function allows the user to automate the process of constructing and 
comparing multimetric indices that require at least one metric of each 
type (as defined by user). This particular function allows the user to 
decide on the number of iterations to compare, with a default of 1000. 
This version of the function uses an input of metrics categorized by type and
uses this information to construct random combinations of metrics with one 
of each type. Several tests are carried out and results are provided for 
each constructed MMI as the output of this function. The tests include the 
mean and standard deviation of reference sites, proportion of intermediate 
and most disturbed sites statistically below reference (interval test), 
and mean and max correlations among metrics within a given MMI. A signal-to-
noise statistic is also calculated for each constructed MMI. 
This code can be customized for the type of data available to the user, so 
some tests can be dropped and others added. The primary benefit of this
code is the set up of randomly selected combinations of metrics.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class='language-R'>prIBI_byType(
  df,
  metList,
  idVars,
  siteVar = "SITE_ID",
  refVar,
  year = NULL,
  indexvis,
  least,
  most,
  nsamp = 1000,
  seed = 20160310
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr><td><code id="df">df</code></td>
<td>
<p>Input data frame with each sample in one row, with sample-identifying 
variables and metrics as columns. Assumed to have metrics already scored or 
rescaled (in whatever manner is desired). Ideally, the MMI is 
built on only calibration sites, and it is assumed any sites in the input 
dataset will be included in MMI development, so exclude any sites that 
shouldn't be used ahead of time. It is assumed that there are multiple visits 
for some sites and that the 'indexvis' argument identifies the visit to use 
for most tests (except signal-to-noise). The default value for the Site 
identifier is 'SITE_ID'.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="metList">metList</code></td>
<td>
<p>Data frame with column of metrics (METRIC) and a column 
called TYPE indicating the metric type (one word, preferably abbreviated). 
If scored metrics have different names than raw metric values, be sure these 
names are the ones in this data frame.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="idVars">idVars</code></td>
<td>
<p>Variable or combination of variables in 'df' used to 
identify individual samples.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="siteVar">siteVar</code></td>
<td>
<p>String containing name of variable that identifies unique 
site ID (across years if site was sampled in multiple years). 
Default value is SITE_ID.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="refVar">refVar</code></td>
<td>
<p>String containing name of reference variable in the dataset</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="year">year</code></td>
<td>
<p>String containing the name of the year variable in the dataset. 
The default value is NULL. If NULL, signal-to-noise calculation is based
only on within year revisits.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="indexvis">indexvis</code></td>
<td>
<p>String containing name of variable to identify whether a 
visit is the index visit to a site, with values of Yes/No. If a record has
an indexvis value of No, it will only be included in signal-to-noise 
calculations.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="least">least</code></td>
<td>
<p>Value of 'refVar' for least disturbed sites in dataset</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="most">most</code></td>
<td>
<p>Value of 'refVar' for most disturbed sites in dataset</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="nsamp">nsamp</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of random combinations to test, with a default of 1000.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code id="seed">seed</code></td>
<td>
<p>Random seed to supply to random number generator used to 
randomly select metric combinations. Default is 20160310.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame containing the iteration number, 
and for each iteration, the combination of metrics in the MMI,
percent of most disturbed sites falling statistically below reference 
(interval test, pct_MMI_M), mean MMI score among reference sites (mn_mmi_ref),
standard deviation among reference sites (sd_mmi_ref), 
signal-to-noise ratio, maximum correlation among
metrics (max_corr), and mean correlation among metrics (mean_corr).
